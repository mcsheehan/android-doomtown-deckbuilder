# doomtown-deckbuilder [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/mcsheehan/android-doomtown-deckbuilder/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/mcsheehan/android-doomtown-deckbuilder/tree/master)


This is an android application to view and eventually to build decks for one of my favourite board games. The card game doomtown reloaded: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/156714/doomtown-reloaded

Continuous integration has been setup using circleci and an android docker image, which I've created on this github account. This setup builds the android application upon each commit. As this build check occurs before merging, the build should always be successful. For completeness I have included the badge indicating the status of the continuous integration.
